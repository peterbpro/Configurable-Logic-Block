# Configurable-Logic-Block


This was the final project for ESE 570 - Digital Circuit Design and VLSI. We combined all of our knowledge in digital circuits to create a Configurable Logic Block which required timing accuracy, and SRAM design. Our CLB had control logic to load the SRAM cells and a pre set value and based on an input address, would read out a single bit. The goal would be to apply this to an FPGA, where the LUT would store some values and implement the functionality of a MUX.  

The final report and Cadence616 files are included in this repo. 

This project was done in collaboration with Cameron Woo.
